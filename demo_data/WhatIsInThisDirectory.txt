What is in this data directory?

Original Data
-------------

demoData.nii.gz
- functional data (as acquired in Experiment C in Agrawal et. al. 2019)
- 3T
- slice time corrected
- motion corrected
- smoothed with 5 mm FWMH Gaussian
- data acquired with presentation of visual stimulus (flickering checkerboard) at 0.13 Hz

Brain_mask.nii, WhiteMatter_mask.nii, VisualCortex_mask.nii, aparcaseg.nii
- masks of functional data (created via Freesurfer (Fischl 2012))
- all registered to the same space as the functional data
- Brain_mask -- mask of brain
- WhiteMatter_mask -- mask of white matter
- VisualCortex_mask -- mask of visual cortex
- aparcaseg -- Freesurfer output with many different ROIs identified

physio.mat
- heart rate and respiration rate as estimated from EKG and resp belt respectively
- specifically, a struct with time (T), heart rate (HR), and respiration rate (RR)
- used to compare the HRAN estimates with HR and RR from EKG and resp belt

HRAN Outputs
------------

demoData_deNoised.nii.gz
- after running hran_demo_nifti, this is the output functional data from HRAN
(which can then be input into other processing pipelines)

estimatedFrequencies_nifti.png, deNoisedVisualCortex_nifti.png
- frequency estimates overlaid on white matter spectrogram and true HR/RR
- de-noised visual cortex ROI demonstrating preservation of signal and removal
of physiological noise

estimatedFrequencies_simulated.png, deNoisedData_simulated.png
- simulated physiological frequency estimates
- simulated de-noised data
